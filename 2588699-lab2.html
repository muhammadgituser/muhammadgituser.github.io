                Good day aquainted reader. I am Muhammad Ahmed 
                - a student at The University of the Witwatersrand,
                 studying Computer Science. I am not much of a programming
                 geek, but I have a newfounnd love for coffee :>

            <p>
                I am currently working on a way to get this site up.
                The purpose of this site is to tell you fine people 
                about myself. 
                Uhh
                Like I said, this newfound love for coffee got me 
                pumped with caffeine in order to sit begind this Computer
                and yap about myself... how conceited, damn.
                Nevermind me, tell me about yourself down here:

                Haha psych, you thought you were that special.
