Hello World,

My name is Muhammad Ahmed and today I am learning how to use Git and GitHub. My initialisation begins with me creating a repository to commit to.
I will undergo steps to complete my task for the day.
The steps I have taken to complete the assignment are as follows:
- Created a repository and have ensured setup was complete.
- I struggled with creating commits, but eventually figured it out.
- I still have not created multiple branches, but plan on doing so as soon as possible.
- And now I am adding some useful files onto my first Git repository.

I hope this information was useful
